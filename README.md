There should be a folder containing president speeches (from 1789-Washington.txt to 2017-Trump.txt) which will be processed by president_helper.py. Here I only included the relevant txt yet. The insufficient number of texts might result in a not-so-accurate result.

script.py is the main code, in which I practice using Word2Vec.
president_helper.py includes some supporting functions which are used in script.py
